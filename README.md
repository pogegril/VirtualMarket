# VirtualMarket

## About the Project

  VirtualMarket was a project developed as an exercise during my studies,
with the premise of developing a fully working app to manage a supermarket's assets, utilizing
the concepts at study in this Data Structure Modeling class.

  With that idea I developed VirtualMarket as one of my first programming projects. Altough 
it has a very simple interface, the main focus of this project was the Java data structure necessary
so the program could manage the different information a store should keep track while providing
useful tools to the user in effort to make this task more convenient.

## Features

> Fully functional Product and Entity data structures for store management,
>
> Overview of the store's balance of profits and expenses updated upon user's input in any of the program's windows,
>
> Simple and direct Java Swing user interface with succint self-explanatory identification of the many provided features;

## Personal lookback

>Despite the functionality provided to the user I personally look back critically on
certain aspects of this project, specially one developed so early in my programming studies. 
Despite fully functional i see many improvements that could be done to the data structure,
from full processes of the many objects to the simple choice of datatypes, there are many choices
i'd rethink that could bring an improvement to both performance and scalability of the program.
>
>Another point of improvement is the data storage method. Although XML was a concept studied in
this class and therefore a required choice for tis project, i would prefer SQLite or similar databases,
as their performance in a bigger scale use context would be significantly improved.
